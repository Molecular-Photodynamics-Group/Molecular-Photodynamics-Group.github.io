Dramatic enhancement in the O atoms photo-generation cross section in comparison with\nthe photodissociation of individual O<sub>2</sub> molecules has been observed. Velocity map images of\nthese “enhanced” O atoms consisted of five channels, different in their kinetic energy,\nangular distribution, and wavelength dependence. Three channels are deduced to be due to the one-quantum excitation\nof the C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>−O<sub>2</sub> complex into the perturbed Herzberg III\nstate (<sup>3</sup>Δ<sub>u</sub>) of O<sub>2</sub>. This excitation results in the prompt dissociation of\nthe complex giving rise to products C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>+O+O when the energy of exciting quantum is higher\nthan the complex photodissociation threshold, which is found to be 41740 ± 200 cm<sup>−1</sup>\n(239.6±1.2 nm). This last threshold corresponds to the photodissociation giving rise to an unexcited\nisoprene molecule. The second channel, with threshold shifted to the blue by 1480 ± 280 cm<sup>−1</sup>,\ncorresponds to dissociation with formation of rovibrationally excited isoprene. A third channel was observed at\nwavelengths up to 243 nm with excitation below the upper photodissociation threshold.
