The BET process is concluded to provide an I<sub>2</sub> molecule in\nthe electronic ground state with moderate vibrational excitation as well as X molecule in the electronic excited state.\nIn the case of X = I<sub>2</sub>, the BET process converts anion I<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> of\nthe CT state into the neutral I<sub>2</sub> in the repulsive excited electronic state which then dissociates\npromptly giving rise to a pair of I atoms in the fine states <sup>2</sup>P<sub>1/2</sub>.\nIn the case of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>–I<sub>2</sub>, the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> molecules appear in\nthe triplet T<sub>1</sub> electronic state. Conical intersection for corresponding BET process becomes\nenergetically accessible after partial twisting of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> frame in\nthe excited CT state of complex. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(T)–I<sub>2</sub> complex gives rise\nto triplet ethylene as well as singlet ethylene via the T-S conversion.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Photodissociation of van der Waals complexes of iodine X–I<sub>2</sub> (X&nbsp;=&nbsp;I<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)  via charge-transfer state: A velocity map imaging investigation\n","journal":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","year":"2017","volume":"147","issue":"23","author":"Bogomolov, Alexandr S. and Goldort, Veniamin G. and Kochubei, Sergei A. and Baklanov, Alexey V.","doi":"10.1063/1.5001104"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"name":"10.1063__1.5001104","type":"publications","slug":"/publications/10.1063__1.5001104","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","ru"],"messages":{"meta.title":"Molecular photodynamics group","meta.description":"Molecular photodynamics group site","pages.404":"Page not found","pages.research-projects":"Research projects","pages.members":"Members","pages.publications":"Publications","pages.contacts":"Contacts","common.abstract":"Abstract","common.more-details":"More details","index-page.header":"Welcome to the page of the Molecular photodynamics group","index-page.image-alt":"Group photo","contacts-page.name":"Voevodsky Institute of Chemical Kinetics and Combustion of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences","contacts-page.address":"Institutskaya 3 <br/> Novosibirsk <br/> Russia <br/> 630090","contacts-page.phone-number":"+7 (383) 330-76-23","contacts-page.email":"baklanov@kinetics.nsc.ru","member-page.interests":"Research interests:","member-page.education":"Education","member-page.now":"now","member-page.publications":"Publications"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/publications/10.1063__1.5001104","redirect":false}}}}
