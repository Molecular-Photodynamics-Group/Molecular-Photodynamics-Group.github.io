I<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> product ions with a translational\ntemperature of 130 K and “translationally hot” I<sup>+</sup> ions with an average kinetic energy\nof <i>E</i><sub>t</sub> = 1.24 ± 0.03 eV and angular anisotropy β = 1.92 ± 0.11 were detected as dimer-specific ionic\nphotofragments. Velocity map images of the I<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> and I<sup>+</sup> species were found to be qualitatively\nsimilar to those observed in the case of photoexcitation of the (CH<sub>3</sub>I)<sub>2</sub>\ndimer (<i>J. Chem. Phys.</i><b>2005</b>, <i>122</i>, 204301). As in the case of the (CH<sub>3</sub>I)<sub>2</sub> dimer,\nthe absence of neutral I<sub>2</sub>-specific features in the ionic species images from (HI)<sub>2</sub> allows us\nto eliminate neutral molecular I<sub>2</sub> as a precursor of I<sup>+</sup> and I<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>.\nSimilar to the case of (CH<sub>3</sub>I)<sub>2</sub>, we deduce that the observed I<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ions are\nproduced in their <sup>2</sup>Π<sub>3/2,g</sub> ground electronic state as a result of photodissociation of the ionized\ndimer (HI)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> + <i>h</i>ν → I<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> + .... The formation of “translationally hot”\nI<sup>+</sup> ions is attributed to photodissociation of nascent vibrationally excited I<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> with\nan average vibrational energy of 1.05 ± 0.10 eV. This vibrational excitation is explained by the nonequilibrium initial\nI−I distance in I<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> arising in photodissociation of (HI)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> after prompt\nrelease of the light H atoms. On the basis of our ab initio calculated value for the I−I distance of (3.17 Å) in\nthe (HI)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> precursor dimer, the vibrational excitation of I<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is\nexpected to be 1.02 eV, which is in quantitative agreement with our experimentally deduced value. The interpretation\nof our results was supported by ab initio calculations of the structure and energy of neutral and ionized dimers of HI at the MP4(SDTQ)//MP2 level.</p>","excerpt":"Photodissociation of the (HI)2 van der Waals dimers at 248 nm and nearby wavelengths has been studied using \ntime-of-flight mass…","frontmatter":{"title":"Ionic Pathways following UV Photoexcitation of the (HI)<sub>2</sub> van der Waals Dimer","journal":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry A","year":"2010","volume":"114","issue":"9","author":"Vidma, Konstantin V. and Parker, David H. and Bogdanchikov, Georgii A. and Baklanov, Alexey V. and Kochubei, Sergei A.","doi":"10.1021/jp9067679"},"fields":{"slug":"/publications/10.1021/jp9067679","locale":"ru"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"name":"10.1021/jp9067679","type":"publications","slug":"/publications/10.1021/jp9067679","locale":"en"}}}
