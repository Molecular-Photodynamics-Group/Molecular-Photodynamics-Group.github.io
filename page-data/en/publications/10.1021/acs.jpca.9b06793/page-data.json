Irradiation of W(CO)<sub>6</sub> by pulsed\nlaser radiation at 266 nm results in the appearance of singly and doubly charged tungsten ions.\nThe isotope composition of these ions deviates essentially from natural abundance with deviation\nbeing pulse energy-dependent. The velocity map images of the tungsten ions indicate proceeding of several,\nmore than two, parallel channels (sequences of the one-photon processes) of photodissociation,\ngiving rise to tungsten atoms. Isotope effect is assigned to appear in a one-photon bound–bound transition in W(CO)\nintermediate followed by its predissociation. In the model suggested, the final state of this transition is a\nvibronic state with excited vibrational mode of W–C stretching vibration. This vibrational excitation is\nresponsible for isotopic shift in the location of the final state. The suggested model fits the observed isotopic\ncomposition quantitatively.</p>","excerpt":"UV photodissociation of tungsten hexacarbonyl W(CO)6 has been studied in the molecular beam conditions \nusing time-of-flight mass…","frontmatter":{"title":"Tungsten Isotope-Specific UV-Photodecomposition of W(CO)<sub>6</sub> at 266&nbsp;nm","journal":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry A","year":"2019","volume":"123","issue":"36","author":"Ershov, Kirill S. and Kochubei, Sergei A. and Baklanov, Alexey V.","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpca.9b06793"},"fields":{"slug":"/publications/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b06793","locale":"ru"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"name":"10.1021/acs.jpca.9b06793","type":"publications","slug":"/publications/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b06793","locale":"en"}}}
