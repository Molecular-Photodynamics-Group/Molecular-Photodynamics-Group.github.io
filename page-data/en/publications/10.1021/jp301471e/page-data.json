The dominant channel of singlet oxygen generation with measured quantum\nyield up to about 2 is attributed to the one-quantum absorption by the encounter complexes O<sub>2</sub>–O<sub>2</sub>.\nThis absorption gives rise to oxygen in the Herzberg III state O<sub>2</sub>(A′ <sup>3</sup>Δ<sub>u</sub>),\nwhich is assumed to be responsible for singlet oxygen production in the relaxation\nprocess O<sub>2</sub>(A′ <sup>3</sup>Δ<sub>u</sub>, υ) +\nO<sub>2</sub>(X <sup>3</sup>Σ<sub class=\"stack\">g</sub><sup class=\"stack\">–</sup>) →\nO<sub>2</sub>({a <sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>\" {b <sup>1</sup>Σ<sub class=\"stack\">g</sub><sup class=\"stack\">+</sup>}) +\nO<sub>2</sub>({a <sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>, υ = 0\" {b <sup>1</sup>Σ<sub class=\"stack\">g</sub><sup class=\"stack\">+</sup>, υ = 0})\nwith further collisional relaxation of b to a state.
