The short-lived phosphorescence of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>\nwith spectral maximum at approximately 1300 nm is observed to follow excitation by pulsed laser radiation at 355 nm\nof TiO<sub>2</sub> suspended in CCl<sub>4</sub> and water H<sub>2</sub>O. The shorter lifetime and spectral shift\nof this phosphorescence, as compared with phosphorescence of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> sensitized by phenalenone\nin these solvents, are attributed to the adsorbed state of emitting singlet oxygen. The observed laser pulse energy\ndependence indicates the two-photon and three-photon nature of this phosphorescence initiation in CCl<sub>4</sub>\nand H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. The formation of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in CCl<sub>4</sub>\nis assumed to be provided by the sequence of one-photon excitation of TiO<sub>2</sub>,\ngiving rise to superoxide anion O<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup> and one-photon photodetachment\nof electron from O<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>. The photodetachment of electron from O<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>\nin water H<sub>2</sub>O is a two-photon process because of higher solvation energy of superoxide anion in water.\nThe processes that govern the rise and decay of singlet oxygen phosphorescence sensitized by TiO<sub>2</sub>\nare discussed. The factors affecting the yield of singlet oxygen provided by electron photodetachment are also considered.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Singlet Oxygen <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in Photocatalysis on TiO<sub>2</sub>.
