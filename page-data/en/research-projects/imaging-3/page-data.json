In our experiments such ions have usually been formed by the quantum state\nselective Resonance Enhanced Multi Photon Ionisation (REMPI) method. We use REMPI-VMI as\na detection technique in a wide variety of our experimental projects to give us a simultaneous measurement of\nthe internal energy &#x26; velocity of reaction products.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Velocity map imaging 3"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"name":"imaging-3","type":"research-projects","slug":"/research-projects/imaging-3","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","ru"],"messages":{"meta.title":"Molecular photodynamics group","meta.description":"Molecular photodynamics group site","pages.404":"Page not found","pages.research-projects":"Research projects","pages.members":"Members","pages.publications":"Publications","pages.contacts":"Contacts","common.abstract":"Abstract","common.more-details":"More details","index-page.header":"Welcome to the page of the Molecular photodynamics group","index-page.image-alt":"Group photo","contacts-page.name":"Voevodsky Institute of Chemical Kinetics and Combustion of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences","contacts-page.address":"Institutskaya 3 <br/> Novosibirsk <br/> Russia <br/> 630090","contacts-page.phone-number":"+7 (383) 330-76-23","contacts-page.email":"baklanov@kinetics.nsc.ru","member-page.interests":"Research interests:","member-page.education":"Education","member-page.now":"now","member-page.publications":"Publications"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/research-projects/imaging-3","redirect":false}}}}
