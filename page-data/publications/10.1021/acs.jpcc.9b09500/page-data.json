The main\narguments of the Comment are directed against Assignment of the NIR Emission and Electron Photodetachment Mechanism\nsuggested by Demyanenko et al.. Particularly the Comment claims that the red shift (near 30 nm) and bandwidth (50-60 nm)\nof the NIR luminescence observed in paper by Demyanenko et al. are too large to be assigned to the luminescence\nof singlet oxygen <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. In the Reply it is shown that several arguments of the Comment are based\non the incorrect statements. The current interpretation of the nature of the red shift and bandwidth of the luminescence\nof singlet oxygen governed by interaction with the environment is considered. It is shown that the characteristics\nof NIR luminescence (rather large red shift and bandwidth as compared with the literature data for the luminescence\nof <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in solutions) observed in experiments by Demyanenko et al. are in a qualitative agreement\nwith expected tendencies.  All the arguments of the Comment are considered in detail and extended reply is given.</p>","excerpt":"In the Comment the authors Y. Nosaka and A. Y.
