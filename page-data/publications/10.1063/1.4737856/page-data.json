Dramatic enhancement in the O atoms photo-generation cross section in comparison with\nthe photodissociation of individual O<sub>2</sub> molecules has been observed. Velocity map images of\nthese “enhanced” O atoms consisted of five channels, different in their kinetic energy,\nangular distribution, and wavelength dependence. Three channels are deduced to be due to the one-quantum excitation\nof the C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>−O<sub>2</sub> complex into the perturbed Herzberg III\nstate (<sup>3</sup>Δ<sub>u</sub>) of O<sub>2</sub>. This excitation results in the prompt dissociation of\nthe complex giving rise to products C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>+O+O when the energy of exciting quantum is higher\nthan the complex photodissociation threshold, which is found to be 41740 ± 200 cm<sup>−1</sup>\n(239.6±1.2 nm). This last threshold corresponds to the photodissociation giving rise to an unexcited\nisoprene molecule. The second channel, with threshold shifted to the blue by 1480 ± 280 cm<sup>−1</sup>,\ncorresponds to dissociation with formation of rovibrationally excited isoprene. A third channel was observed at\nwavelengths up to 243 nm with excitation below the upper photodissociation threshold. This channel is attributed\nto dissociation with the formation of a bound O atom C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>−O<sub>2</sub> +\n<em>hv</em> → C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>−O<sub>2</sub>(<sup>3</sup>Δ<sub>u</sub>) →\nC<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O + O and/or to dissociation of O<sub>2</sub> with borrowing of the lacking energy\nfrom incompletely cooled complex internal degrees of freedom\nC<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub><sup><em></sup>−O<sub>2</sub> + <em>hv</em> → C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub><sup></em></sup>\n−O<sub>2</sub>(<sup>3</sup>Δ<sub>u</sub>) → C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub> + O + O.\nThe kinetic energy of the O atoms arising in two other observed channels corresponds to O atoms produced by\nphotodissociation of molecular oxygen in the excited a <sup>1</sup>Δ<sub><em>g</em></sub> and b1\nΣ+gb1Σg+ singlet states as the precursors. This indicates the formation of singlet oxygen O<sub>2</sub>\n(a <sup>1</sup>Δ<sub><em>g</em></sub>) and O<sub>2</sub>(b1Σ+gb1Σg+) after excitation of the\nC<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>−O<sub>2</sub> complex.
