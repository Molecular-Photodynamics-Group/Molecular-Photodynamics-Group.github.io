In the gas phase, the transient Li<sup>+</sup> and LiI<sup>+</sup> ion signals feature\ndamped oscillations due to the excitation and decay of a vibrational wave packet. Based on high-level <i>ab initio</i>\ncalculations of the electronic structure of LiI and simulations of the wave packet dynamics,\nthe exponential signal decay is found to result from predissociation predominantly at the lowest\navoided X-A potential curve crossing, for which we infer a coupling constant V<sub>XA</sub> = 650(20) cmâˆ’1.
