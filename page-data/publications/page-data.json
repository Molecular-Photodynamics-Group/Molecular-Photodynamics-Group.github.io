Using the MS-TOF technique,\natomic titanium and titanium(II) oxide (TiO) were detected among the most abundant photofragments.\nExperimental results were rationalized with the aid of quantum chemical calculations (DLPNO–CCSD(T) and DFT).\nContrary to the existing data in the literature, the new four-centered acetone-elimination reaction was found to be\nthe primary decomposition process of TTIP. According to computational results, the effective activation barrier\nof this channel was ∼49 kcal/mol, which was ∼13 kcal/mol lower than that of the competing propylene elimination.\nThe former process, followed by the dissociative loss of an H atom, was a dominating channel of\nTTIP unimolecular decay. The sequential loss of isopropoxy moieties via these two-step processes was supposed\nto produce the experimentally observed titanium atoms. In turn, the combination of these reactions with propylene\nelimination can lead to another detected species, TiO. These results indicate that the existing mechanisms of\nTTIP thermal and photoinitiated decomposition in the chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) of titanium dioxide should\nbe reconsidered.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Decomposition Pathways of Titanium Isopropoxide Ti(O<sup>i</sup>Pr)<sub>4</sub>: New Insights from UV-Photodissociation Experiments and Quantum Chemical Calculations","journal":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry A","year":2018},"fields":{"slug":"/publications/10.1021__acs.jpca.7b10396"}}},{"node":{"id":"12bb9cd0-f21a-5d0f-8b3d-c55e63cd9972","html":"<p>UV photodissociation of tungsten hexacarbonyl W(CO)<sub>6</sub> has been studied in the molecular beam conditions\nusing time-of-flight mass spectrometry and velocity map imaging. Irradiation of W(CO)<sub>6</sub> by pulsed\nlaser radiation at 266 nm results in the appearance of singly and doubly charged tungsten ions.\nThe isotope composition of these ions deviates essentially from natural abundance with deviation\nbeing pulse energy-dependent. The velocity map images of the tungsten ions indicate proceeding of several,\nmore than two, parallel channels (sequences of the one-photon processes) of photodissociation,\ngiving rise to tungsten atoms.

In the model suggested, the final state of this transition is a\nvibronic state with excited vibrational mode of W–C stretching vibration.
