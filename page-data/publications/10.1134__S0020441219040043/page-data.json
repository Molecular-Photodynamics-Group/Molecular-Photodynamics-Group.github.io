The apparatus was successfully tested when studying\nthe resonant ionization of oxygen molecules. The automation software makes it possible to extend\nthe possibilities of measuring spectral dependences by creating additional modules without\nmodifying the existing program code.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"An Automated Apparatus for Measuring Spectral Dependences of the Mass Spectra and Velocity Map Images of Photofragments","journal":"Instruments and Experimental Techniques","author":"Dozmorov, N.
