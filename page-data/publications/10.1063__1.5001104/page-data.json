The BET process is concluded to provide an I<sub>2</sub> molecule in\nthe electronic ground state with moderate vibrational excitation as well as X molecule in the electronic excited state.\nIn the case of X = I<sub>2</sub>, the BET process converts anion I<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> of\nthe CT state into the neutral I<sub>2</sub> in the repulsive excited electronic state which then dissociates\npromptly giving rise to a pair of I atoms in the fine states <sup>2</sup>P<sub>1/2</sub>.\nIn the case of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>–I<sub>2</sub>, the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> molecules appear in\nthe triplet T<sub>1</sub> electronic state.
