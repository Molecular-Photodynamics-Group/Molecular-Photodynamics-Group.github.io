The use of solar light in photocatalytic process of water splitting for hydrogen production is a key point for hydrogen 
energetics. Other fields of current and perspective applications of photocatalysis are water and air-purification from 
organic impurities, self-cleaning and sterilization of surfaces, "green chemistry" and others. All these applications 
dictate very big interest of the researches to the problems of photocatalysis. Titanium dioxide is the most effective 
known photocatalyst. But it has one disadvantage due to bad overlapping with the spectrum of solar radiation. 
For shifting of its absorption spectrum into the visible, the coverage by dyes is used as well as doping by different 
admixtures. On the way to creating the future efficient TiO2-based photocatalysits the main problem is the lack of 
knowledge about mechanism of photocatalytic process, including mechanism of reactive intermediates photogeneration 
responsible for photocatalytic behavior of titanium dioxide. Efficient catalytic activity and better fitting of 
absorption to solar radiation spectrum is provided by other superconductor tungsten trioxide WO<sub>3</sub>. For creation of 
task-oriented photocatalysts based on WO3 it is also necessary to know mechanism of oxygen-involved photocatalytic 
processes on its surface. It is known that the surface centers play a key role in heterogeneous catalysis. Moreover 
there is a perspective direction in photocatalysis where isolated centers of titanium oxide are used which are named 
single site catalysts. This approach allows one to provide many unusual photocatalytic processes where bulky 
photocatalysts are less effective. Mechanism of these sites action is not clear. Approach suggested in this project 
which is based on the use of small cluster (TiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>as the model should allow us to investigate the mechanism of reactive 
intermediates photogeneration on these centers.  Suggested approach based on the use of small clusters (TiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub> as a 
model of photocatalyst allows us to study mechanism of reactive intermediates photogeneration on these centers. 
According to the data of quantum-chemical calculations of structure and electronic properties of small clusters of 
tungsten trioxide even small clusters (WO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>n</sub> (n=2-4) can be considered as an adequate model for the study of 
photocatalytic processes in bulky photocatalyst. Generation of complexes of these clusters with oxygen in molecular 
beam allows us to use powerful technique of identification and investigation of elementary photoprocesses based on 
the velocity map imaging of photofragments appearing after photoexcitation of complexes. For investigation of these 
processes new approach is suggested. This approach is based on the use of complexes of small clusters of TiO<sub>2</sub> 
and WO<sub>3</sub> with oxygen as the model for the study of the processes proceeding on the surface of photocatalyst. 
This approach seems to be very promising because possibility to generate these complexes in molecular beam allows one to study 
elementary steps of heterogeneous photochemistry with the use of very powerful techniques like velocity map 
imaging which were elaborated for gas phase studies. Within our research, it is supposed to identify and investigate 
elementary photoprocesses, which govern photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide and tungsten trioxide, 
to establish structure and energetic characteristics of photocatalyst-oxygen complexes, to study their photophysics 
and photochemistry, and to study supramolecular photoprocesses, analogous to those revealed by us in weakly bound 
complexes of oxygen. It is also supposed to study the effect of water molecules inclusion in the complex. 

We have already discovered the process of formation of singlet oxygen from superoxide anion on the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub> 
passing through the formation of superoxide anion as a result of electron photodetachment. We have shown that singlet 
oxygen reacts with titanium dioxide to form titanium peroxide without an activation barrier. We think that similar fast 
processes also take place on the surface of the photocatalyst particles. In connection with the important role of 
titanium and tungsten peroxides, their study is of great interest. But for this it is necessary to learn how to get 
them and we intend to investigate this question. Assessing the relevance of the planned research, it should also be 
noted that the importance of studying the mechanism of photogeneration of singlet oxygen and the implementation of a 
direct method for measuring the kinetics of processes involving superoxide anion is not limited to problems of 
photocatalysis. The fact is that singlet oxygen is an active agent in many biological systems, and is also a key agent 
in photodynamic therapy, widely used in the treatment of oncology. Therefore, new knowledge about the mechanisms of 
generation of singlet oxygen can be useful in many applications. The same applies to superoxide anion, which plays an 
important role in many biological processes. Reactions involving this particle are important from the point of view 
of such phenomena as oxygen toxicity, the formation and development of malignant tumors, the aging process. 
Superoxide anion plays a very important role in oxidative stress. Therefore, we believe that the results of the 
planned project aimed at studying the elementary physicochemical processes of photocatalysis will be of great 
importance in the application to the study of the above phenomena.
