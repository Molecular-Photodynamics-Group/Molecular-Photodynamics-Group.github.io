A pulsed source for production of metal atoms and their oxide compounds in a supersonic expansion is described. 
The design utilizes a simple pulsed valve and produces a concentration of 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> atoms per cm<sup>−3</sup> of the desired metal
atoms in a molecular beam. Depending on the carrier gas used, metal compounds at similar concentration levels can also be produced.
