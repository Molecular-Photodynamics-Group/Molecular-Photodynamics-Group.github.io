Photoexcitation of van der Waals (vdW) complex CH<sub>3</sub>I-O<sub>2</sub> has been studied with 
velocity map imaging of I atoms arising in photodissociation. A new scheme of resonance-enhanced multiphoton 
ionization of iodine atoms has been applied with simultaneous use of UV and VIS radiation. The measured kinetic 
energy of I(<sup>2</sup>P<sub>3/2</sub>) atoms indicates photogeneration of precursor CH<sub>3</sub>I molecules 
via complex-specific channel with excitation energy expected for double spin-flip transition in 
complex CH<sub>3</sub>I-O<sub>2</sub>. The angular distribution for recoil directions of I(<sup>2</sup>P<sub>3/2</sub>) 
atoms coming from vdW complexes also corresponds to that expected for double spin-flip transition.
