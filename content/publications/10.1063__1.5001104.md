The photodissociation of van der Waals complexes of iodine X–I<sub>2</sub> (X = I<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) 
excited via Charge-Transfer (CT) band has been studied with the velocity map imaging technique. 
Photodissociation of both complexes gives rise to translationally “hot” molecular iodine I<sub>2</sub> 
via channels differing by kinetic energy and angular distribution of the recoil directions. 
These measured characteristics together with the analysis of the model potential energy surface 
for these complexes allow us to infer the back-electron-transfer (BET) in the CT state to be a source 
of observed photodissociation channels and to make conclusions on the location of conical intersections where 
the BET process takes place. The BET process is concluded to provide an I<sub>2</sub> molecule in 
the electronic ground state with moderate vibrational excitation as well as X molecule in the electronic excited state. 
In the case of X = I<sub>2</sub>, the BET process converts anion I<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> of 
the CT state into the neutral I<sub>2</sub> in the repulsive excited electronic state which then dissociates 
promptly giving rise to a pair of I atoms in the fine states <sup>2</sup>P<sub>1/2</sub>. 
In the case of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>–I<sub>2</sub>, the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> molecules appear in 
the triplet T<sub>1</sub> electronic state. Conical intersection for corresponding BET process becomes 
energetically accessible after partial twisting of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> frame in 
the excited CT state of complex. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(T)–I<sub>2</sub> complex gives rise 
to triplet ethylene as well as singlet ethylene via the T-S conversion.
