The desorption of excited rubidium atoms off the surface of helium nanodroplets 
is studied in detail using femtosecond time-resolved photoion and photoelectron imaging spectroscopy in 
combination with quantum wave-packet simulations. The good agreement of the measured time-dependent 
velocity distributions with the simulation when exciting the Rb dopant atoms into the 6p
state supports the pseudodiatomic model for the Rb-He droplet interaction, even on the level of 
quantum wave-packet dynamics. Time-resolved photoelectron spectra reveal the partitioning of excitation 
energy into the dopant and the droplet degrees of freedom.
