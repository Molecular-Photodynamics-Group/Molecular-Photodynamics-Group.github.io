The channel of singlet oxygen O<small><sub>2</sub></small>(<small><sup>1</sup></small>Δ<small><sub>g</sub></small>) 
photogeneration from van der Waals complexes of oxygen X–O<small><sub>2</sub></small> has been investigated 
to discriminate between two possible mechanisms based on charge-transfer (CT) or double spin-flip (DSF) transitions. 
The results obtained in this work for complexes with 
X = ethylene C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>, 
1,3-butadiene C<small><sub>4</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small>, deuterated methyl iodide 
CD<small><sub>3</sub></small>I, benzene C<small><sub>6</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small> 
and water H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and for those investigated previously indicate the DSF 
mechanism as a source of singlet oxygen. The formation of O<small><sub>2</sub></small>
(<small><sup>1</sup></small>Δ<small><sub>g</sub></small>) is observed only when the energy of exciting 
quantum is sufficient for DSF transition. Universally detected low vibrational excitation of 
O<small><sub>2</sub></small>(<small><sup>1</sup></small>Δ<small><sub>g</sub></small>) arising in 
the photodissociation of van der Waals complexes X–O<small><sub>2</sub></small> indicates the DSF 
mechanism as its source. For complex of ethylene 
C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>–O<small><sub>2</sub></small> <em>ab initio</em> 
calculations of vertical energy Δ<em>E</em><small><sub>vert</sub></small> for DSF and CT transitions 
have been carried out. The positive results of singlet oxygen formation from 
C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>–O<small><sub>2</sub></small> can be explained 
by the DSF but not by the CT mechanism.
