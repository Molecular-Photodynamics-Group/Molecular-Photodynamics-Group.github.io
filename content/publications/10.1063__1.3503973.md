Van der Waals binding energies for the X–O<sub>2</sub> 
complexes (X=Xe, CH<sub>3</sub>I, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>) are determined 
by analysis of experimental velocity map imaging data for O(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>2</sub>) atoms arising from UV-photodissociation 
of the complex [A. V. Baklanov et al., J. Chem. Phys. 126, 124316 (2007)]. Several dissociation pathways have 
been observed, we focus on the channel corresponding to prompt dissociation of X–O<sub>2</sub> into X+2O(<sup>3</sup>P) fragments, 
which is present for complexes of O<sub>2</sub> with all partners X. Our method is based on analysis of the kinetic 
energy of all three photofragments, where the O atom kinetic energy was directly measured in the experiment 
and the kinetic energy of the X partner was calculated using momentum conservation, along with 
the measured angular anisotropy for O atom recoil. We exploit the fact that the clusters are all T-shaped or 
nearly T-shaped, which we also confirm by ab initio calculations, along with knowledge of the transition dipole 
governing radiative absorption by the complex. The effect of partitioning the kinetic energy between translation 
along the X–O<sub>2</sub> and O$-$O coordinates on the angular anisotropy of the O atom recoil direction is discussed. 
Van der Waals binding energies of 110 ± 20 cm<sup>−1</sup>, 280 ± 20 cm<sup>−1</sup>, 135 ± 30 cm<sup>−1</sup>, and 585 ± 20 cm<sup>−1</sup> 
are determined for Xe$-$O<sub>2</sub>, CH3I$-$O<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>$-$O<sub>2</sub>, 
and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>$-$O<sub>2</sub> clusters, respectively.
