Ab initio calculations have been carried out to investigate interaction of titanium dioxide TiO<sub>2</sub> 
with oxygen O<sub>2</sub> in ground triplet and excited singlet states. On a singlet potential energy 
surface (PES) formation of a stable compound of titanium peroxide TiO<sub>4</sub> is revealed which 
should appear in reaction of TiO<sub>2</sub> with singlet oxygen without activation barrier. 
This peroxide is lower in energy than the ground state of two individual molecules 
TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;3O<sub>2</sub> by 34.6&nbsp;kcal/mol. Location of conical intersection 
between triplet and singlet PESs of TiO<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> is also investigated.
