The predissociation dynamics of lithium iodide (LiI) in the first excited A-state is investigated 
for molecules in the gas phase and embedded in helium nanodroplets, using femtosecond pump-probe 
photoionization spectroscopy. In the gas phase, the transient Li<sup>+</sup> and LiI<sup>+</sup> ion signals feature 
damped oscillations due to the excitation and decay of a vibrational wave packet. Based on high-level <i>ab initio</i> 
calculations of the electronic structure of LiI and simulations of the wave packet dynamics, 
the exponential signal decay is found to result from predissociation predominantly at the lowest 
avoided X-A potential curve crossing, for which we infer a coupling constant V<sub>XA</sub> = 650(20) cmâˆ’1. The 
lack of a pump-probe delay dependence for the case of LiI embedded in helium nanodroplets indicates fast 
droplet-induced relaxation of the vibrational excitation.
