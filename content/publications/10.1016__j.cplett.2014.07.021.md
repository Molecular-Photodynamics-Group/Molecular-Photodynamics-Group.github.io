Photogeneration of singlet oxygen O<sub>2</sub>(<em>a</em><sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>) resulted from photoexcitation at 
248 and 266&nbsp;nm of isoprene-oxygen mixtures at elevated oxygen pressure has been investigated. 
Pulse energy and oxygen pressure dependence of the singlet oxygen yield indicate one-quantum 
photoexcitation of the encounter complex isoprene-oxygen C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>–O<sub>2</sub> 
as a source of O<sub>2</sub>(<em>a</em><sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>). 
Suggested mechanism of O<sub>2</sub>(<em>a</em><sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>) photogeneration involves direct 
excitation of complex with simultaneous change of both partner spins like that observed in van der Waals complex 
C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>–O<sub>2</sub> [Vidma et al., J. Chem. Phys. 137 (2012) 054305]. Other supposed pathways 
involve collision-induced photogeneration of Herzberg III state O<sub>2</sub>(<em>A</em>’<sup>3</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>) 
or triplet isoprene as the intermediates.
