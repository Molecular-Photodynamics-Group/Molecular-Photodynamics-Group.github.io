Using femtosecond pump–probe ion imaging spectroscopy, we establish the key role of 
I<small><sup>+</sup></small> + I<small><sup>−</sup></small> ion-pair (IP) states 
in the predissociation dynamics of molecular iodine I<small><sub>2</sub></small> excited to 
Rydberg states. Two-photon excitation of Rydberg states lying above the lowest 
IP state dissociation threshold (1st tier) is found to be followed by direct parallel transitions 
into IP states of the 1st tier asymptotically correlating to a pair of I ions in their lowest states 
I<small><sup>+</sup></small>(<small><sup>3</sup></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small>) + 
I<small><sup>−</sup></small>(<small><sup>1</sup></small>S<small><sub>0</sub></small>), 
of the 2nd tier correlating to I<small><sup>+</sup></small>(<small><sup>3</sup></small>P<small><sub>0</sub></small>) + 
I<small><sup>−</sup></small>(<small><sup>1</sup></small>S<small><sub>0</sub></small>), and of the 
3rd tier correlating to I<small><sup>+</sup></small>(<small><sup>1</sup></small>D<small><sub>2</sub></small>) + 
I<small><sup>−</sup></small>(<small><sup>1</sup></small>S<small><sub>0</sub></small>). 
Predissociation <em>via</em> the 1st tier proceeds presumably with a delay of 1.6–1.7 ps which 
is close to the vibrational period in the 3rd tier state (3rd tier-mediated process). 
The 2nd tier IP state is concluded to be the main precursor for predissociation <em>via</em> 
lower lying Rydberg states proceeding with a characteristic time of 7–8 ps and giving rise to 
Rydberg atoms I(5s<small><sup>2</sup></small>5p<small><sup>4</sup></small>6s<small><sup>1</sup></small>). 
The channel generating I(<small><sup>2</sup></small>P<small><sub>3/2</sub></small>) + 
I(<small><sup>2</sup></small>P<small><sub>1/2</sub></small>) atoms with total kinetic 
energy corresponding to one-photon excitation is found to proceed <em>via</em> a pump – 
dump mechanism with dramatic change of angular anisotropy of this channel as compared with earlier nanosecond experiments.
