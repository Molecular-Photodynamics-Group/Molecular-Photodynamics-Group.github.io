A broadband near-IR photodetector based on a large-area G12180-250A InGaAs photodiode (Hamamatsu) with a 5-mm-diameter 
photosensitive area was developed and tested. It is designed for detecting the IR luminescence of singlet oxygen. 
A circuit for signal amplification is assembled on the basis of broadband low-noise operational amplifiers with the 
subsequent filtering of a signal with an adjustable passband $f$ varied from 15 to 600 kHz, thus allowing one to obtain 
a time resolution of better than 1 $\mu$s, a sensitivity level of 107$-$109 V/W, and a noise equivalent 
power NEP [W/Hz<sup>1/2</sup>] ≈ 1.4 x 10<sup>-14</sup> $\lambda$<sup>-1</sup>[$\mu$m] $f$[kHz] in a frequency band of 15$-$600 kHz.
