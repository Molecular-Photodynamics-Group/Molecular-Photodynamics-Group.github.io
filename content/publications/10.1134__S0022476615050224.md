Quantum chemistry methods are used to analyze in detail the structure of the van der Waals complex of ethylene 
with oxygen C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>–O<sub>2</sub>, and binding energies for stable configurations of the complex 
are calculated. The calculations are carried out by the MP2 method using the 6-311++G(2<em>d</em>,2<em>p</em>) 
and aug-cc-pV<em>n</em>Z (<em>n</em> = 2, 3, 4) basis sets. It is demonstrated that the most stable structure of the 
van der Waals complex of ethylene with oxygen is a structure with <em>C</em><sub>2<em>v</em> </sub> symmetry, 
where the oxygen and ethylene molecules are located parallel and lie in the same plane. The calculation of the 
binding energy for this structure using the aug-cc-pV<em>n</em>Z (<em>n</em> = 2, 3, 4) basis sets with the extrapolation 
of results to the infinite basis set limit (<em>n</em>→∞) gives a value of 206 cm<sup>–1</sup>.
