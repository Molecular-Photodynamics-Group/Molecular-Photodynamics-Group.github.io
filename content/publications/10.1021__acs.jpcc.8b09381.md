Features of the near-infrared phosphorescence of singlet oxygen <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> photosensitized by 
TiO<sub>2</sub> in solutions have been investigated. The short-lived phosphorescence of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> 
with spectral maximum at approximately 1300 nm is observed to follow excitation by pulsed laser radiation at 355 nm 
of TiO<sub>2</sub> suspended in CCl<sub>4</sub> and water H<sub>2</sub>O. The shorter lifetime and spectral shift 
of this phosphorescence, as compared with phosphorescence of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> sensitized by phenalenone 
in these solvents, are attributed to the adsorbed state of emitting singlet oxygen. The observed laser pulse energy 
dependence indicates the two-photon and three-photon nature of this phosphorescence initiation in CCl<sub>4</sub> 
and H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. The formation of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in CCl<sub>4</sub> 
is assumed to be provided by the sequence of one-photon excitation of TiO<sub>2</sub>, 
giving rise to superoxide anion O<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup> and one-photon photodetachment 
of electron from O<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>. The photodetachment of electron from O<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup> 
in water H<sub>2</sub>O is a two-photon process because of higher solvation energy of superoxide anion in water. 
The processes that govern the rise and decay of singlet oxygen phosphorescence sensitized by TiO<sub>2</sub> 
are discussed. The factors affecting the yield of singlet oxygen provided by electron photodetachment are also considered.
